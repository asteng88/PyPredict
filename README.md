# PyPredict
This is a tool used for statistical analysis of data in MS Excel files using either Linear Regression or the ARIMA model.
It can produce a graph of the results and a pdf report of the analysis and the graph.

## Creating the virtual environment to run the code:
Python 3.10.9
pip install pandas statsmodels openpyxl pmdarima sklearn reportlab matplotlib.
Uninstall numpy and install version 1.23.5 (pip install numpy==1.23.5) - This is to ensure compatibility with the pmdarima package

The venv should be good to go.
